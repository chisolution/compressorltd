## Introduction

This document outlines the development standards and practices for the Compressor Ltd website project. All team members are expected to follow these guidelines to ensure code quality, maintainability, and consistency across the project.

## Coding Standards

### PHP

- Follow PSR-12 coding standards for PHP code.
- Use type hints and return type declarations where possible.
- Use meaningful variable and function names.
- Keep functions and methods small and focused on a single responsibility.
- Use dependency injection instead of global state.
- Use Laravel's built-in features and conventions.

### CSS/SASS

- Use BEM (Block Element Modifier) methodology for CSS class naming.
- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes for layout and styling.
- Use SASS for custom components and complex styling.
- Keep nesting to a maximum of 3 levels.
- Use variables for colors, spacing, and other repeated values.

### JavaScript

- Use ES6+ syntax.
- Use meaningful variable and function names.
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility.
- Use async/await for asynchronous code.
- Avoid jQuery when possible, use vanilla JavaScript or Alpine.js.

## Git Workflow

### Branching Strategy

- `main` branch: Production-ready code.
- `develop` branch: Integration branch for features.
- Feature branches: Created from `develop` for new features.
- Hotfix branches: Created from `main` for urgent fixes.

### Commit Messages

- Use the imperative mood ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
- Start with a capital letter.
- Keep the first line under 50 characters.
- Provide a detailed description if necessary after the first line.
- Reference issue numbers in the commit message.

### Pull Requests

- Create a pull request for each feature or bug fix.
- Provide a clear description of the changes.
- Reference related issues.
- Ensure all tests pass before requesting a review.
- Require at least one code review before merging.

## Testing

### Unit Testing

- Write unit tests for all new features and bug fixes.
- Use PHPUnit for PHP code testing.
- Aim for at least 80% code coverage.
- Use test doubles (mocks, stubs) to isolate the code being tested.

### Feature Testing

- Write feature tests for critical user flows.
- Test happy paths and edge cases.
- Use Laravel's built-in testing features.

### Browser Testing

- Test across major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
- Test on mobile devices (iOS and Android).
- Use responsive design testing tools.

## Documentation

### Code Documentation

- Document all classes, methods, and functions.
- Use PHPDoc for PHP code.
- Document complex algorithms and business logic.
- Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes.

### Project Documentation

- Maintain up-to-date README files.
- Document environment setup and configuration.
- Document API endpoints and parameters.
- Document database schema and relationships.

## Security

### General Guidelines

- Follow OWASP Top 10 security guidelines.
- Use Laravel's built-in security features.
- Keep dependencies up-to-date.
- Use HTTPS for all connections.
- Implement proper authentication and authorization.

### Data Protection

- Sanitize all user input.
- Use prepared statements for database queries.
- Hash passwords using bcrypt.
- Protect against CSRF attacks.
- Implement proper validation for all forms.

## Performance

### Database

- Use eager loading to avoid N+1 query problems.
- Index frequently queried columns.
- Use database transactions for complex operations.
- Optimize queries for performance.

### Frontend

- Minimize and compress CSS and JavaScript files.
- Optimize images for web.
- Use lazy loading for images and heavy content.
- Implement caching strategies.

### Backend

- Use caching for expensive operations.
- Implement queue jobs for long-running tasks.
- Use pagination for large data sets.
- Optimize database queries.

## Deployment

### Environment Setup

- Use environment variables for configuration.
- Keep sensitive information out of version control.
- Document environment requirements.

### Deployment Process

- Use automated deployment scripts.
- Implement continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD).
- Run tests before deployment.
- Implement database migrations safely.
- Have a rollback strategy in case of deployment issues.

### Monitoring

- Implement error logging and monitoring.
- Set up performance monitoring.
- Monitor server resources.
- Set up alerts for critical issues.
